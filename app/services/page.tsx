              </h3>
              <p className="text-charcoal/70">
                Therapy sessions focus on emotional processing, healing past wounds, and developing coping strategies.
                Coaching sessions are more goal-oriented, focusing on building confidence, clarifying purpose, and
                taking action. Our SoulSpring Blend combines both approaches.
